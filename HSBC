it should be will trail and error based
where it time taking process
like and not like need to check
where partitioning is using & if is there or clustering like string fild need to be check
check dev env like dev sample data to on weather data is which porpoise

1.It will be a trial-and-error process, .multiple trials might be needed. While checking the SQLs, I noticed some queries processing very small MB sizes in development or test regions , so I need to understand the exact issue and region.

2. Dev data is very limited, so I will need non-prod data to check how long the queries actually take with real volume.

3. When testing in the dev environment, the file sizes are very small, so the performance behaviour is not accurate.
