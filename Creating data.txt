Hi \[Manager's Name],

I wanted to inform you that my grandfather passed away yesterday. I will need to take leave from 2nd July to 4th July (3 days) to attend the rituals and be with my family.

Kindly approve my leave request. I will resume work on 5th July and continue with my deliverables as planned.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Regards,
Manikanta
